**What is Data Structure?**
Data Structrure is a way of organizing and storing data in a structured manner. So that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.It is a building blocks for any software programs. In laymen term it is like a different type of storage containers in your house.Each container is designed for a specific purpose, Making It easier to organise and retrieve things when we need it.
Some type of data structures are **List, Dictonary, Tuple, Set**

**Concept Of Big-O-Notation**
In most of the DSA's we are not aware about this concept and ofcourse in the Interviews also they will not go indepth on this concept.But for our better understanding of what are all the things available in the DSA we will gonna cover it.
Big O Notation is used to measure the running time or the freespace requirements for your program grows and the input size also grows.
Consider you have defined a list with some elements say like 100 items in the list, and it will take hardle 0.1 or 0.2 milliseconds. but if you have the size of list as 1000 or more then the time will get rapidly increased like 2 milli seconds or even more. So the program size and data size will be directly proportional to the time consumed by it.Also the processor which you have in your machine plays a big role to process the data.
In Simple Laymen term, The Big O notation is like a speed-o-meter in your code. It helps us to measure how fast or slow our algorithm performs when the size of the data increases.
**Below are the Examples**
Constant Time - Fastest one considering the performance represents O(1) **RT examples* Finding a book on your desk
Logarithmic Time - Considerable fast  and it uses binary search to acheive. O(log n) **RT examples* Searching for a work in a dictionary
Linear Time - Looping through a list of elements and it is slower one. O(n) **RT examples* Searching for a book in a pile of books
Quadratic Time - Nested loop (slower one) for example bubble sort method. O(n^2) **RT examples* Comparing every student’s name with everyone else’s in a class 
Exponential Time - It will run without optimization. It is considered as a very slow one.O(2^n)
